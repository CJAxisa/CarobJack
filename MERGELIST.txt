Completed Merging my code with CJ's Code:
Player.cs
TomeManager.cs

Added all of my scripts to the project

Errors to deal with:
NONE

Complete:
- Making two scenes called _main_scene and test_scene
- Also moving yuug scene and the menu_scene to the test scene
- Make sure that the FF_Animator is working
- Made a separate player perfab for me to work with called player2
- InputManager needs to have all of the xbox one controls added to it
- Cleaning up code in all of the scripts:
	- This includes removing all instances of Animator because we will not be using this anymore
	- Moving all Yuug animations to the FF_Animator
	- Moving all of the player states to a single file for better organization
